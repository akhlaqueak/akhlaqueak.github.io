**Our paper got the best paper award at HPDC 2025**

Our paper titled "Our-of-core Parallel Spatial Join Outperforming In-Memory Systems" won the best paper award at HPDC 2025. 
The paper proposed T-spatial, a system designed to work with very large datasets that can’t completely fit in memory. Key innovations include the unleashing of massive parallelism that breaks up the job into many smaller tasks to run simultaneously, high-throughput out-of-core processing on SSDs with parallel IO threads, disk IO optimization leverages spatial locality and reduces redundant page reads, and a hybrid BFS-DFS model that enables efficient IO access patterns with bounded memory consumption.
