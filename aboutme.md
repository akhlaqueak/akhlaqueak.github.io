I am a researcher and educator specializing in large-scale data systems, graph analytics, and high-performance computing. My work spans cutting-edge problems in scalable graph mining, GPU-accelerated algorithms, geospatial analytics, and 3D graphics reconstruction, with publications in top venues including VLDB, ICDE, KDD, CIKM, HPDC, and SIGSpatial. I have contributed to award-winning research on out-of-core spatial joins, developed efficient GPU-based frameworks for subgraph discovery, and explored the intersection of machine learning and big data systems. Alongside my research, I bring extensive teaching experience across database systems, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and systems programming, shaped by over a decade of academic appointments in the US, Turkey, Pakistan, and Italy. I am passionate about building scalable computational solutions, mentoring students, and advancing data-driven research that bridges theory, systems, and real-world applications
